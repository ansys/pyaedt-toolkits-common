Installation
============

If you want to use this library for your toolkit or automated workflow, you can install the backend standalone or
install backend and user interface common methods.

You can install both backend and user interface methods from PyPI::

    pip -m install git+https://github.com/ansys-internal/pyaedt-toolkits-common.git[all]

You can install only the backend methods from PyPI, this is useful if you only need the common API::

    pip -m install git+https://github.com/ansys-internal/pyaedt-toolkits-common.git
